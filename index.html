            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
            <p>The Pyramids of Giza stand as enduring symbols of ancient Egypt's grandeur and mastery of engineering. Located on the outskirts of Cairo, these monumental structures have captivated the world for millennia with their sheer size, precision, and mystique. Built during the Old Kingdom period, they remain one of the most iconic archaeological sites on Earth.</p>
            <h3>Structure:</h3>
            <p>The Pyramids of Giza consist of three main pyramids - the Great Pyramid of Khufu, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Menkaure - along with smaller pyramids, temples, and the Great Sphinx. The Great Pyramid of Khufu, standing at over 450 feet tall, held the title of the tallest man-made structure for over 3,800 years. Its precision engineering and alignment with astronomical phenomena continue to intrigue scholars and visitors alike.</p>
            <h3>Pourpose:</h3>
            <p>Beyond serving as royal tombs, the pyramids were conceived as monumental expressions of pharaonic power and divine authority. They were believed to facilitate the pharaohs' transition to the afterlife and ensure their eternal rule as gods among mortals. The complex burial rituals and accompanying funerary goods reflect the ancient Egyptians' deep-seated beliefs in the afterlife and the preservation of the soul.</p>
